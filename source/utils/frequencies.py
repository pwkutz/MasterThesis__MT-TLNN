### Frequencies analysis
'''
I want to show that SCM and TROLL forces (traction force, here) are correlated even if we take separatelly different frequencies, therefore multi-fidelity usage is justified. And we don't need to learn an additional dependencies (like some unpresnet frequencies) between the lower and higher fidelities in our MF ML model? Or on the contrary and this shows some specific dependenies between the signals? 

### Cross Spectrum Analysis/Spectral coherence

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(signal_processing)

(Power) Spectral density - density over the frequencies present in the signal (related to auto-correlation). Cross spectral density - between signals (related to the cross-correlation).
What does this plot shows exactly...? 
Cross-correlation of signals in frequency domain. The CSD of a signal pair is the Fourier transform of the pairâ€™s cross-correlation.
* To determine coincidence, use cross spectral density.
'''

## Cross-power spectral density
def cross_spec():
    f, Pxy = csd(troll_force, scm_force.flatten())
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
    plt.semilogy(f, np.abs(Pxy)) # set log-scale
    plt.xlabel('frequency [Hz]')
    plt.ylabel('CSD [V**2/Hz]')
    plt.show()

'''
Coherence: The coherence function estimates the extent to which a measurement of y(t) can be predicted using a measurement of x(t) with a linear function, meaning this is the time series analog of the coefficient of determination from Gaussian statistics

Coherence (x, y) = CSD(x,y)**2/(Spectral density(x)*Spectral density(y))

* To determine linearity, use coherence.
'''

'''
**Note that all of the above quantities are defined in the frequency domain based on measurements in the time domain. These values tell you about dependencies between signals in specific bandwidths.**

correlate prediction and real simulation after cutting signal's frequencies from different sides...? like, correlate pred<1Hz with real<1Hz, then 2>pred>1Hz with 2>real>1Hz, and so on...
